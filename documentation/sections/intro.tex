\section{Introduction}
\label{Sec:intro}

We implemented the A* algorithm, both parallel and sequential versions, on large and weighted benchmark graphs.
Then we studied the performance and compared the two algorithms.
\\
The project implied:
\begin{itemize}
    \item reading of large weighted benchmark graphs
    \item run of A* parallel, sequential and standard Djkstra algorithm
    \item comparison considering computation time, memory usage and visited nodes
\end{itemize}
