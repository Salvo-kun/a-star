\section{Introduction}
\label{Sec:intro}

Implementation of the A-Star algorithm both parallel and sequential versions on large and weighted benchmark graphs.
Study on performance and comparison between the 2 implementations.

The project implies:
\begin{itemize}
    \item reading of large weighted benchmark graphs
    \item run of A-Star parallel, sequential and standard Djkstra algorithm
    \item comparison considering computation time and memory usage
\end{itemize}
