\section{Possible Enhancement}
\label{Sec:enhancement}

Looking at the experimental results (Section \ref{Sec:experimental-eval}) our parallel A* implementation has good performance, 
but we thought about possible enhancements for our algorithm.
In particular:
\begin{itemize}
    \item parallelization of graph reading
    \item implementation of abstract zobrist hashing for the compute recipient function
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Parallel graph reading}

With the current sequential graph reading the time for the graph creation is slower than path finding: for the large map it is up to 70 seconds.
To improve the performance a possible solution would be parallelizing the graph generation from the input file,
but we did't find an efficient way to parallelize it at thread level.


\subsection{Abstract zobrist hashing}

Looking at the experimental tests (Section \ref{Sec:experimental-eval}) we understood the importance of a good hash for the compute recipient function.
Many scientific papers (eg. \cite{bibParAstar}) explain that the abstract zobrist hashing should have better performances than the multiplicative,
because it can balance better the load of the threads and minimize the communication overhead.
We tried to implement it achieving poor results and, since it needed to store additional data inside the graph, it penalized 
other implementation's performances, thus we decided to remove it.
