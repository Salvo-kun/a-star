\section{Possible Enhancement}
\label{Sec:enhancement}

Looking at the experimental results (\ref{Sec:experimental-eval}) our parallel A* implementation has good performance, 
but we thought at some Enhancement for our algorithm

\begin{itemize}
    \item parallelization of graph reading
    \item implementation of zobrist hashing for the compute recipient function
\end{itemize}
