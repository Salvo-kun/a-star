\section{A-Star Implementation}
\label{Sec:implementation}

The A-Star algorithm is based on the use of a heuristic function which exstimates the cost from a point to a destination node.

Both implementations are based on two set, the OPEN and the CLOSE one. The first is implemented using a priority queue (our heap \ref{heap}) and contains nodes that have been discovered but not expanded yet, the other one with a hash table (\ref{hash_table}) and contains node that have been expanded.

All vertex contains a link to a parent vertex which is used to keep trace of the path found by the algorithm, at the end the solution is inserted in a stack (\ref{stack}) pushing from the goal node and going backward.

\begin{alltt}
    1 Initialize OPEN to \{s_0\};
    2 while OPEN \(\neq\) 0; do
    3 Get and remove from OPEN a node n with a smallest f(n);
    4 Add n to CLOSED;
    5 if n is a goal node then
    6   Return solution path from \(s_0\) to n;
    7 for every successor n' of n do
    8   $g_1$ = g(n) + c(n; \(n'\));
    9   if n' \(\in\) CLOSED then
    10      if g_1 < g(n') then
    11          Remove n' from CLOSED and add it to OPEN;
    12      else
    13          Continue;
    14  else
    15      if n' \(\notin\) OPEN then
    16          Add $n'$ to OPEN;
    17      else if $g_1$ \(\geq\) g($n'$) then
    18          Continue;
    19  Set g($n'$) = g_1;
    20  Set f($n'$) = g($n'$) + h($n'$);
    21  Set parent($n'$) = n;
    22 Return failure (no path exists);
\end{alltt}

Where
\begin{itemize}
    \item $s_0$ : is the starting node
    \item $g(n)$ : is the cost of the best known path from $s_0$ to $n$
    \item $h(n)$ : is the heuristic function
    \item $f(n)$ : is the sum $g(n) + h(n)$, used in the OPEN set to calculate the priority
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Parallel}

Implementation of the decentralized AStar algorithm, where each thread has its own CLOSED and OPEN set, when a thread discovers a neighbouring node choses the thread that will expand it and sends a message to it.
\\
When a thread find a solution, it compares the cost with the global one and if it has a lower cost, it just change the cost with the new one (the global cost is protected with a lock).

\subsubsection{Pseudo-code}

Starting pseudo-code taken from (insert biblio)

\begin{alltt}
    1 Initialize OPENp for each thread p;
    2 Initialize incumbent.cost = \(\infty\);
    3 Add s0 to OPENComputeRecipient(s0);
    4 In parallel, on each thread p, execute 5-31;
    5 while TerminateDetection() do
    6   while BUFFERp \(\neq\) 0 ; do
    7       Get and remove from BUFFERp a triplet (n0; g1; n);
    8       if n0 2 CLOSEDp then
    9           if g1 < g(n0) then
    10              Remove n0 from CLOSEDp and add it to OPENp;
    11             else
    12                  Continue;
    13      else
    14          if n0 =2 OPENp then
    15              Add n0 to OPENp;
    16          else if g1  g(n0) then
    17              Continue;
    18      Set g(n0) = g1;
    19      Set f(n0) = g(n0) + h(n0);
    20      Set parent(n0) = n;
    21  if OPENp = ; or Smallest f(n) value of n 2 OPENp \(\geq\) incumbent.cost then
    22      Continue;
    23  Get and remove from OPENp a node n with a smallest f(n);
    24  Add n to CLOSEDp;
    25  if n is a goal node then
    26      if path cost from s0 to n < incumbent:cost then
    27          incumbent = path from s0 to n;
    28          incumbent.cost = path cost from s0 to n;
    29  for every successor n0 of n do
    30      Set g1 = g(n) + c(n; n0);
    31      Add (n0; g1; n) to BUFFER ComputeRecipient(n);
    32 if incumbent:cost = 1 then
    33  Return failure (no path exists);
    34 else
    35  Return solution path from s0 to n;
\end{alltt}

Where
\begin{itemize}
    \item $BUFFER$ : structure used for thread communication (\ref{thread_buf})
    \item $incumbent$ : the shared best known path
    \item $TerminateDetection$ : function to check if the path search is completed \ref{terminate}
    \item $ComputeRecipient$ : function that choses the thread that will expand the node (\ref{compute_reci})
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Compute recipient}
\label{compute_reci}

A Function that is able to map the nodeId into a thread identifier, and which is used to decide to which thread send a message with the node to expand.
This function can considerably change the performance of the algorithm.
\\ We provided two different implementation:
\\
The basic module is the simplest one and it is computed as: \\
$node\_id \; \% \;  number\_of\_threads$
\\
A more efficient function, but still simple to implement, is the multiplicative hashing computed as: \\
$ h(node\_id) =((a*node\_id \; + \; b) \; \% \; p) \; \% \; number\_of\_threads $  
\\ where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $p$: prime large number (we used INT\_MAX =  $ 2^{31}-1 $)
    \item $a$: random integer [1,p-1]
    \item $b$: random integer [0,p-1]
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Thread communication}
\label{thread_buf}

A message queue \ref{message_queue} structure is used to allows threads to communicate: a thread compute the recipient and send a message using the thread destination with the node and cost. 

\subsubsection{Terminate condition}
\label{terminate}

When a thread has its OPEN set empty or there isn't elements that will improve the cost of the path, it sets its termination\_flag.
A thread waits on his condition variable only if it has no message pending and its termination\_flag is set, if all other threads are waiting the program terminates instead.
When a thread sends a message to another one it signal its condition variable in order to waking it up. 

\begin{alltt}
    1 lock mutex
    2 while termination_flags[this_thread] and
    BUFFER(this_thread) = 0 AND not program_terminated
    3   if(counter \( \geq \) n_threads - 1 AND all buffer empty
    4       program_terminated = 1
    5       signal all condition variables
    6   else
    7       counter++
    8       wait on condition variable of this_thread
    9       counter--
    10 unlock mutex
    11 if program_terminated
    12   return true
    13 else
    14   return false
\end{alltt}

Where
\begin{itemize}
    \item $termination\_flags$: array of flags setted by a thread when the OPEN set is empty or does not has any node with a minor cost then the actual path
    \item $program\_terminated$: flag setted by last thread awake when it detects the termination of the program
    \item $counter$: counter of sleeping threads
    \item $mutex$: global mutex to protect all condition variables
    \item $BUFFER$: message queue of each thread
\end{itemize}
